# Project Specific (Generated Object Files is .ht)
*.ht
!tests/*.ht   # Keep test artifacts if they are checked in source? No, test.ht is generated? No, test.ht is expected input but not present. I'll ignore generated .ht.
# Actually, benchmarks/*.ht are generated.
# Tests sometimes use .ht as input? 
# The assembler outputs .ht.
# Let's ignore all .ht for now as they are build artifacts.
